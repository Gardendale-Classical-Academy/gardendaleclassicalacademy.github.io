      <h2>ABOUT GARDENDALE CLASSICAL ACADEMY</h2>

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Gardendale Classical Academy focuses upon three important practices in Christianity: prayer, study, and action.  These three provide a foundation that cultivate the development of multifaceted students who are grounded in faith, excellent in academics, and intentional in their duty to the community.

      <p> <strong style="float: left;">Motto</strong>
       <br><br>
       "Pro Deo, pro Ecclesia, pro Texana" was inspired by the motto of Baylor University, which was founded during the years of the Republic of Texas.  This motto, translated from Latin, is "For God, for Church, for Texas" and reminds us that we do not live for ourselves, but for the sake of God, of His Body in the earth, and of our homeland.  Our desire for our students is that they fully reach their potential, recognize God's calling, and live in the world as excellent examples of ambassadors of the kingdom of heaven.<br><br><br>

       <strong style="float: left;">Logo</strong>
       <br><br>

       A simple shield with the face of a crown-bearing lion (a monarch) and the academy motto serves as the principal logo for Gardendale Classical Academy.<br><br><br>

       <strong style="float: left;">Mission</strong>
       <br><br>

       Gardendale Classical Academy exists to provide a classical education in a Christ-centered environment to equip students for a lifetime of excellence in learning, service, and leadership to the glory of God.<br><br><br>

       <strong style="float: left;">Colors</strong><br><br>
