      Families who choose to make full payment of tuition will receive a 5% discount per student.  Those who choose to make payment for an entire semester will receive a 2.5% discount per semester per student.  And families may choose to pay tuition via a monthly payment schedule (usually ten months).  With this option, the first tuition payment is due on the first business day of August and the last tuition payment is collected on the first business day of May.

Parents are encouraged to seek out the possibility of tuition reimbursement or scholarships which may be offered through their employers' human resources department.  Professional organizations to whom the parents belong sometimes offer opportunities for financial aid or scholarships.</p>
